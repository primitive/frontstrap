## About The Project
This was created as an early experiment using Frontity as a headless CMS for WordPress. It was a great learning experience but the project got mothballed during Covid. We decided to fix a few issues with the existing deployment but are moving to an alternative approach for headless deployments.

### Prerequisites
-------------------------------

**The following pre-requisites should be in place for the theme to work:**
1. WordPress install of version 5.0 or later
2. Optional but highly recommended: register a domain
3. If deploying to Vercel install WordPress to a sub directory e.g. - wp.example.com
4. Posts permalink set set to: Custom Structure e.g. - `/posts/%postname%/`
5. Set homepage to a static page
6. Some features may require the use of the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin


### Installation & Development
-------------------------------

*** Follow the Frontity setup outlined in their [Docs](https://docs.frontity.org/getting-started/quick-start-guide) ***

**To use this theme**
You can install the theme and packages from the NPM/Github registry. You will need to extract the frontstrap package to edit 'src/components/dust/_config' and copy frontity.settings.js to the root of your project.

The simpler option is to clone the demo repo:

1. `git clone https://github.com/primitive/frontstrap`
2. `cd frontstrap`
3. `npm install && npx frontity dev (from the project's root directory)`

```
npx frontity dev
```

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The site will automatically reload if you make changes inside the `packages` folder. You will see the build errors in the console.


### Deployment
------------------------------------

*** Follow the Frontity deployment outlined in their [Docs](https://docs.frontity.org/installation-and-deploy) ***

```
npx frontity build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

This will create a `/build` folder with a `server.js` (a [serverless function](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction)) file and a `/static` folder with all your javascript files and other assets.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

This project was made when [Frontity](https://frontity.org/), [Bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) had a wild night with lots of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

Bootstrap then had a fight with [Rebass](https://rebassjs.org/) and it all got a bit freaky... 🤡
