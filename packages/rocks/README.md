# Primitive Rocks

Primitive Rocks! (Block + Smart Component) Library

![](https://primitivedigital.uk/wp-content/uploads/img/punky_logo_smgreen.png)

WordPress as a Headless CMS with a smattering of Node.js and React magic. 

Built on the once awesome, itty bitty, [Frontity](https://frontity.org/) framework. With little help from our friends: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) and [ScrollMagic](https://scrollmagic.io/).

This project was made when [Frontity](https://frontity.org/), [Bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) had a wild night with lots of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

Bootstrap then had a fight with [Rebass](https://rebassjs.org/) and it all got a bit freaky... 🤡
