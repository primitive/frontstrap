### Primitive

Primitive's Rolling Mountains (Beautiful Views)


**N.B.:**
Frontity will be deprecated in favour of a new framework.
This repo will be archived and the theme will be re-released as a new package.

**Frontity Framework is not under active development anymore.**

**Frontity currently supports Node >= 16.**
Node 17+ uses [OpenSSL 3](https://nodejs.org/ca/blog/vulnerability/openssl-november-2022/).

- [Openssl Enable Legacy Renegotiation](https://pipeawk.com/index.php/2022/05/19/openssl-enable-legacy-renegotiation/)
- [node: --openssl-legacy-provider is not allowed in NODE_OPTIONS](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/node-openssl-legacy-provider-is-not-allowed-in-node-options)

Possible workaround

```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

This issue will be fixed in node v18.


### Development


```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "local": {
      "frontstrap": "./packages/frontstrap",
      "@primitive/pebbles": "./packages/pebbles",
      "@primitive/rocks": "./packages/rocks",
      "@primitive/scenes": "./packages/scenes"
    },
    "published": {
      "frontstrap": "^0.0.11",
      "@primitive/pebbles": "^0.0.8",
      "@primitive/rocks": "^0.0.10",
      "@primitive/scenes": "^0.0.7"
    }
  }
}
```

```
npx frontity dev
```

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The site will automatically reload if you make changes inside the `packages` folder. You will see the build errors in the console.

> Have a look at our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.frontity.org/getting-started/quick-start-guide)

### Create your custom theme

```
npx frontity create-package your-custom-theme
```

Use the command `npx frontity create-package` to create a new package that can be set in your `frontity.settings.js` as your theme

### Create a production-ready build

```
npx frontity build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

This will create a `/build` folder with a `server.js` (a [serverless function](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction)) file and a `/static` folder with all your javascript files and other assets.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

> Get more info about [Frontity's architecture](https://docs.frontity.org/architecture)

### Deploy

With the files generated in the _build_ you can deploy your project

#### As a node app

Use `npx frontity serve` to run it like a normal Node app.

This command generates (and runs) a small web server that uses the generated `server.js` and `/static` to serve your content

#### As a serverless service

Upload your `static` folder to a CDN and your `server.js` file to a serverless service, like Now or Netlify.

Logs are somewhat of a rant. Packages created I was experimenting with different approaches and trying to get my head around the framework plus testing some capabilities of modern CSS specs vs CSS-IN-JS.
